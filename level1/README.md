1. Write a program that creates two threads: one that prints even numbers from 1 to 10, and another that prints odd numbers. Ensure they alternate printing without using synchronization yet 

2. Write a main thread that spawns 3 child threads, each sleeping for a random time and printing their ID. Use join() to wait for all to complete before the main thread prints a finishing message.

3. Create 3 threads that must complete in sequence using join()

4. Create a non-daemon thread that runs a loop printing "Working..." every second, and a daemon thread that prints "Monitoring..." every 2 seconds. Observe what happens when the main thread exits.
